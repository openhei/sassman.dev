<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  Hi, I'm Sven. I live in Munich, Germany most commonly known for ü•® and üç∫ and I'm an independent Polyglot Software Engineer and work for
  Enterprises and Corporations doing business software development.
</p>

<p>
  Also I have a graduate degree in computer science (Dipl. Inf. FH) from 2006. During my studies I specialized on software engineering, AI and databases.
</p>

<p>
  As a software engineer I focus mostly on backend and lesser on frontend development that interfaces via GraphQL, gRPC or RestAPIs, as well as dealing with big databases and devops infrastructure topics.
</p>

<p>
  Part of my role is also guide junior developers on the path to get stronger in typescript, test driven development and idiomatic programming.
  Furthermore I write about learnings and try to put out complicated things in a simple way.
</p>

  This site in under development and gives me the space to explore
